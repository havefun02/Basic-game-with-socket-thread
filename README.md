# This project demonstrate the communication between server and client in a online game project.
# The communications among these party are established by socket layer, and using raw TCP socket to transfer the data.
# Another technique need to be applied into project to handle the concurrent logic is multi-thread. This is need for a online game project, for example the server need to handle multi-client instead a single client and these flow of data need to be handle in real-time, therefore multi-thread is extremely necessary.
